# **Night Vision Camera with Light Intensity Detection**  

This project is a **real-time night vision camera** with **light intensity detection**, built using OpenCV and NumPy. It enhances visibility in low-light conditions by applying **histogram equalization** and generates a pseudo-night vision effect. The program also analyzes the surrounding light intensity and displays warnings if the brightness level is too high.  

## **Features**  
✅ **Real-Time Night Vision Mode** – Enhances visibility using histogram equalization.  
✅ **Light Intensity Detection** – Analyzes and displays the average brightness level.  
✅ **Dynamic Brightness Warning** – Alerts the user if the light intensity is too high.  
✅ **Camera Flip Support** – Horizontally flips the camera feed for a more natural viewing experience.  
✅ **User-Friendly Controls** – Press **'Q'** to exit the application.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy
